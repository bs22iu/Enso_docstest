# Enso

## What is Enso?

Enso is a survey and interview tool designed with a focus on collecting social networks. Enso is different than other survey taking software in two ways. First, Enso’s focus is on collecting network data, such as relatives to the interviewee and ties between the alters. Second, Enso makes this collection easy, simple, and fun for respondents using gamification and interactive questions.
